# Fake News Detection using Flask and Python

This project aims to develop a web-based application for detecting fake news using machine learning techniques. The application utilizes a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to classify news articles as either true or fake based on their content.

Key Features
News Classification: The application can classify news articles as true or fake using a trained machine learning model.

Web Interface: A user-friendly web interface allows users to input news text and receive a classification result.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and classification reports.

Team and About Pages: Additional pages provide information about the project team and the project itself.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for developing the application.

Flask: A lightweight web framework for creating the web interface.

NLTK & Scikit-Learn: Libraries used for natural language processing and machine learning tasks.

HTML/CSS: Used for designing the web interface.

How to Run
Clone the repository.

Install required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run the Flask application using python app.py.

Access the application at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Future Improvements
Enhance model accuracy by incorporating more advanced machine learning techniques or larger datasets.

Expand the web interface to include additional features such as user authentication or news article storage.
